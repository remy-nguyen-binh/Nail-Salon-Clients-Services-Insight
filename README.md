# Nail Salon Business Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset from a business nail salon in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to gain insights into the business’s customer base, sales trends, and employee productivity.

## Recommendations
Based on the data insights gathered, here are some targeted recommendations to improve customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and sales performance:

### 1. Age and Gender Distribution
#### Insight
The average customer age is 41 years, with two distinct groups: 25-34 years old and 55-64 years old. The gender distribution is nearly balanced at 51% female and 49% male.

#### Recommendation:

- Segmented Marketing: Tailor marketing campaigns to the two key age groups. For younger customers (25-34), consider promoting trendy services like Gel Nails and Nail Art through social media. For the older group (55-64), highlight the benefits of relaxing services like pedicures and foot massages.
- Male Clientele: With nearly equal representation of male clients, introduce gender-neutral or male-focused services to tap into this emerging market. Promotions or loyalty programs aimed at men could encourage higher engagement.

### 2. Service Preferences
#### Insight: 
Gel Nails are the most popular service (18%), but other services like Manicures, Pedicures, and Foot Massages also hold equal weight (17%). Nail Art and Acrylic Nails are slightly less favored.

#### Recommendation:

- Promote Add-ons: Bundle popular services like Gel Nails with lower-demand services such as Nail Art or Acrylic Nails. Offering package deals or discounts on complementary services may increase uptake of these less favored options.
- Seasonal or Event-Based Promotions: Run campaigns focused on popular services during high-traffic seasons (e.g., holidays) to increase overall bookings and revenue.

### 3. Payment Methods
#### Insight
Mobile and credit card payments dominate, with cash payments being the least popular.

#### Recommendation

- Upgrade Payment Options: Since customers prefer contactless and card payments, ensure that your salon’s mobile and card payment options are seamless and user-friendly. Consider offering incentives for digital payments, like discounts or loyalty points, to further encourage their use.
- Reduce Cash Handling: Given the low use of cash, you could minimize cash handling processes, improving operational efficiency and reducing error risks.

### 4. Walk-in vs Pre-Booking
#### Insight
Pre-booking is slightly more popular (51%) than walk-ins (49%).

#### Recommendation

- Enhance Online Booking System: Invest in making the pre-booking process even smoother, potentially through mobile app integrations or more user-friendly online platforms. - Offer promotions for pre-booked services to encourage more clients to plan their visits in advance.
- Maintain Walk-in Flexibility: However, don’t neglect the importance of walk-in customers. Ensure that the salon maintains flexibility to accommodate them by optimizing staffing levels during peak hours.

### 5. Customer Satisfaction
#### Insight
The satisfaction ratings show a worrying trend with the most common ratings being 3 out of 5 (22%) and 2 out of 5 (21%), suggesting room for improvement. Only 20% of customers gave a 5-star rating.

#### Recommendation

- Collect Feedback: Implement a more detailed feedback system to understand why customers are not highly satisfied. Regular surveys could help pinpoint areas for improvement, whether in service quality, staff friendliness, or appointment wait times.
- Customer Experience Training: Focus on improving staff-client interactions, possibly through customer service training. Happy customers are more likely to leave positive reviews and become repeat clients.
- Loyalty and Reward Programs: Introduce a loyalty program offering perks like discounts or complimentary services to returning customers. It could help drive more 4 and 5-star ratings by making clients feel valued.
